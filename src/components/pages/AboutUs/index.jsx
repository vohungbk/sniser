                                Sniser has set out to come to grips with the reality
                                of art and internet. Whist appreciating the value
                                that the internet has brought to the spread of
                                information and media, it has also reduced the
                                control that artists have over their content. We seek
                                to provide a means for owners of intellectual
                                property to be able to better protect and limit
                                content. In doing so, they will be better able to
                                monetise their content and provide unique offerings
                                to those given access.

                                Most reference to blockchain technology centres on
                                cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. However, this is
                                only a small area of web 3.0. We believe that the
                                true strength of new technologies in this space is to
                                provide an open and verifiable ledger of ownership.
                                Ethereum and several other protocols have created non
                                fungible tokens that can be used to give limited
                                ownership of content to specified users. It is within
                                this space that Sniser seeks to be at the forefront
                                of advances in non-fungible tokens.{" "}

                                Many artists want to remain artists and not have to

                                followers to monetise. There exists a group of
                                creatives, who want their art to be their vocal

                                        Hi and welcome to Sniser. I'm Sniserman, I
                                        guide our audience through the crypto related
                                        world. I've teamed up with the men behind
                                        Sniser to provide a totally unique and new
                                        service that allows you to profit from the
                                        crypto world without any active input. How do
                                        we do this? Well we use this software (known
                                        as an algorithm) to buy crypto assets when
                                        they are undervalued and sell them when they
                                        increase in value.
                                      </p>

                                      <p>
                                        With the assistance of the Sniser staff, I
                                        will provide you with the tools needed to get
                                        the best out of our service. So if you have
                                        questions about how to trade crypto feel free
